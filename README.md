# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of analyzing and visualizing data to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies. It is a crucial step before building machine learning models or making data-driven decisions.

EDA helps in:
1. Understanding the structure and quality of dataset
   Get insights into the structure, size, and types of data.
   Identify missing values and inconsistencies.

2. Summarize Statistical properties
   Calculate measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of variables.

3. Detect outlie and Anomalies
   Use box plots, histograms, and scatter plots to identify unusual data points.

4. Visual Relationships
   Use correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and bar charts to explore relationships between features.

5. Feature engineering
   Create new meaningful features to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

# Description
Vehicle Price Prediction is a data science problem where we analyze historical vehicle data to build insights and estimate the price of used or new vehicles based on various features. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) plays a crucial role in understanding the dataset, identifying relationships between features, and improving model performance through feature engineering.
